# Lists

Lists are the core organizational layer in Karakeep. Every saved item can sit in multiple lists so you can group links by project, topic, or audience without duplicating them.

## Manual lists

- Curated sets you add bookmarks to by hand. Great for projects, reading queues, or hand-picked collections.
- Can be **private** (visible only to you) or **public** (share a read-only link).
- Can be **collaborative**: invite people by email as viewers or editors. Editors can add their own bookmarks; viewers can browse. Your personal states (favourite/archive) stay yours even inside a shared list.

## Smart lists

- Auto-updating lists powered by a saved search query (e.g. `#ai -archived`).
- Best for dynamic views like `Youtube links added last week` or `All reddit links from r/selfhosted`.
