          2. Data We Collect
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          We collect the following types of data:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Account information</strong>: email address, name, profile
            image, authentication identifiers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Content you provide</strong>: links, notes, uploads, and
            other data you choose to save in the Service. We may process this
            content — including via third-party artificial intelligence
            providers — to provide features such as full-text search, automatic
            tagging, and AI-powered summaries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Billing and subscription data</strong>: plan status, billing
            events, and limited payment metadata from payment providers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical and usage data</strong>: logs, device/browser
            details, IP address, and service events needed to run, secure, and
            troubleshoot Karakeep.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Support communications</strong>: information you send when
            contacting support.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          3. How We Use Data
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          We use your data to run and improve Karakeep Cloud, including to:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>create and manage your account;</li>
          <li>store and present your content;</li>
          <li>manage subscriptions and payments;</li>
          <li>detect abuse, fraud, and security incidents;</li>
          <li>monitor reliability and fix issues;</li>
          <li>comply with legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          4. Legal Bases (EEA/UK)
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          If you are in the EEA or UK, we rely on the following legal bases:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Contract</strong>: to create and manage your account, store
            your content, and provide core product features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: to keep the service reliable
            and secure, prevent abuse, and provide support.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal obligation</strong>: to comply with tax, accounting,
            and lawful requests from authorities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consent (where required)</strong>: for optional processing
            where consent is the lawful basis; you can withdraw consent at any
            time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Where we rely on legitimate interests, we balance those interests
          against your rights and freedoms.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          5. Sharing and Processors
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          We use subprocessors to run Karakeep Cloud. They only process data on
          our instructions and under contractual safeguards. Current key
          providers include:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Hetzner</strong> (hosting and infrastructure, with primary
            data storage in Europe).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stripe</strong> (payments and billing events).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>OpenAI</strong> (content processing for features such as
            automatic tagging and summaries).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          We do not voluntarily disclose data to law enforcement. We require
          valid legal process (such as a court order or warrant) before
          providing any user data, and we will notify affected users unless
          legally prohibited from doing so.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          We do not sell your personal data. We only access account content when
          needed to help with support requests, investigate abuse or security
          issues, or meet legal obligations.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          For paid plans, payments are handled by our payment provider (for
          example, Stripe). We do not store full payment card details on our
          systems.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          6. International Transfers
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Karakeep Cloud stores primary data in Europe. Some subprocessors may
          process data outside your country (including outside the EEA/UK).
          Where required, we rely on recognised safeguards for cross-border
          transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or adequacy
          decisions.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          7. Cookies and Similar Technologies
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          We use essential cookies and similar technologies to keep you signed
          in, protect against cross-site request forgery, and remember basic
          preferences. We do not use third-party advertising or tracking
          cookies. You can adjust cookie settings in your browser, but disabling
          essential cookies may prevent parts of the Service from working
          properly.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          8. Data Security
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to
          protect your personal data against unauthorised access, loss, or
          misuse. These include encryption of data in transit, access controls,
          and regular security reviews. No system is completely secure, and we
          cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          9. Data Retention and Deletion
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          We keep personal data only as long as needed to run the Service and
          meet legal obligations. When you delete your account, we delete your
          data. Residual copies may remain in encrypted backups for up to 90
          days before being purged.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">10. Your Rights</h2>

          Regardless of where you live, we extend the following rights to all
          Karakeep Cloud users:
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">11. Children</h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Karakeep Cloud is not intended for children under 16. If you believe a
          child gave us personal data in violation of this policy, contact us
          and we will take appropriate action.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          12. Browser Extension
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          The Karakeep browser extension works with your Karakeep account. It
          includes an optional feature that, when enabled, sends URLs of pages
          you visit to check whether they already exist in your library. This
          feature is off by default and requires you to opt in. The data is sent
          only to Karakeep Cloud and is not shared with third parties. Content
          is saved to your account only when you explicitly choose to save it.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          URLs sent for existence checking are not stored and are not used for
          analytics or profiling. Only content you explicitly choose to save is
          added to your account.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          13. Self-Hosted Deployments
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          This policy applies to Karakeep Cloud. If you self-host Karakeep, your
          data stays entirely on your own infrastructure and we do not collect
          or have access to any of it. You are responsible for your own data
          practices and compliance.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          14. Changes to This Policy
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be
          published on this page with an updated effective date. Your continued
          use of the Service after a revised policy is published constitutes
          your acceptance of the changes.
