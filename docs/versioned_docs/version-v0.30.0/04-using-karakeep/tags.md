# Tags

Tags are lightweight labels you can attach to any bookmark to add meaning without rigid folders.

- Use tags to capture topics, sources, people, or workflow states (e.g. `ai`, `design`, `to-read`).
- Combine multiple tags to filter or build smart lists; tags travel with a bookmark wherever it appears.
- AI tags might look a little messy, but the extra labels make finding things easier. Use tags for broad discovery and lists when you want a clean, hand-picked setup.
